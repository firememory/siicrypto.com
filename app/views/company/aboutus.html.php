<h2>About Us </h2>
<p>SiiCrypto is a crypto currency exchange facilitating trading in GreenCoinX the world’s first crypto currency that requires user identification. It has strong and experienced management, headed up by Danny Wettreich, an experienced merchant banker, as Chairman, Sabrina Schmitz, a former commercial banker as CEO, and Nilam Doctor, an experienced crypto currency technologist, as Chief Technical Officer.</p>
<p>We are crypto currency enthusiasts who seek to provide a solid crypto/fiat currency exchange site. We have been inspired to provide this service by the launch of GreenCoinX (XGC) the world’s first identifiable crypto currency, which we believe will lead to worldwide acceptance of crypto currency. We provide the services of exchanging, buying and selling GreenCoinX or for Euro (EUR), Sterling (GBP), US Dollar (USD), and Canadian Dollar (CAD) as well as Bitcoin (XBT).</p>

<h3><strong>SiiCrypto is a REALLY safe crypto currency exchange.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Client assets are safe because all client funds are held in a third party trust fiduciary account requiring the client signature before funds are accessed.</li>
<li>Governments and banks compliance requirements are satisfied because (a) full “Know Your Client” (KYC) procedures are required before SiiCrypto accounts are opened, and (b) full Anti Money Laundering (AML) procedures are utilized.</li>
<li>A SiiCrypto compliance officer must also sign off before funds or crypto currency can be sent by the exchange, which ensures that no transfers to external third parties can be completed by clients. Funds and crypto currency can only be used to complete SiiCrypto exchange transactions and/or can be refunded to clients. SiiCrypto has a built-in compliance protocol to enable approvals with MultiSig.</li>
<li>No Bitcoin is accepted for deposit without the depositor complying with KYC and AML requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What does this mean?</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>It means that clients know that their money cannot be affected by circumstances that may impact SiiCrypto, as no client funds are held by SiiCrypto.</li>
<li>It means that owners of Bitcoin cannot hide their identity when they deposit Bitcoin with SiiCrypto.</li>
<li>It means that no KYC and AML procedures can be bypassed as funds can only be used for trading on the SiiCrypto exchange or refunding back to clients.</li>
<li>It means that governments and banks should have no concerns that “bad actors” can hide their activities if they use the SiiCrypto exchange for transactions.</li>
<li>It means that, unlike many other crypto currency exchanges, SiiCrypto cannot use client assets for its own benefit.</li>
</ol>
